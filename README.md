## Features 

- Map-to-map rotation for the Goons.
- Increased rotation chance the longer they stay on a map.
- Custom chat bot to track of the Goons' location and rotation chances.
- Configurable spawn chances.

## Installation

Drag and drop the contents of the zip directly into your SPT install.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "debugLogs": false,
  "preventSameMapRotation": false,
  "goonsSpawnChance": 35,
  "rotationInterval": 180
}
```
- preventSameMapRotation: If enabled, the Goons will not be able to rotate to the same map they were on previously I.E Customs => Customs
- rotationInterval: Maximum amount of time they can stay a map in minutes, the longer they stay on a map, the higher the chances of them rotating.

## Rotation

On server start, the mod will evaluates whether the Goons should rotate based on how long theyâ€™ve stayed on their current map. The rotation chance increases as they approach their rotation time limit and is capped at 100%. B
y default, the Goons stay on a map for roughly 3 hours.
Rotations only happen at the **server start** or **end of raid**.
